README File for assignment 1, Sri Harsha Thota, 200050138
Instructions for Running Part 5a : 
    1) Place the assignment folder in the examples directory of libhttp
    2) Run 'make cflask' for building the executable
    3) Run the executable as './cflask <port> <number of threads>'

Part 5b : 
    AIM : To perform a load test of the server (local) + functions provided as per part 5a for increaing request rate 
        and comparison of the average response time and throughput(#requests/second)
    
    SETUP : 
        The cflask executable was run on one instance of the terminal in the localhost at port (8080) with threadpools 100, 150, 200
        On the other instance, the load test functions with the command similar to "ab -n 20000 -c 70 http://127.0.0.1:8080/arithmetic/fibonacci?num=40" were run to obtain the outputs
        Metrics : Requests per second
        Independent parameters: Threadpool magnitude, total requests, concurrency factor
        Hypothesis : Throughput increases and then flattens at a certain load value.
        Observations and Explanations : 
            The general trend across the fibonacci, prime and pingpong functions with respect to the Threadpool size 
                showed that the throughput increases with the threadpool size
            The trend for each of the threadpool size was generally increasing with number of concurrent requests and then flattens eventually
                with certain exceptions which can be attributed to the fact that the tests were done on the local machine and the combinations of 
                threadpool sizes and number of concuurent requests

Analysis :
In the first test, I have given weights of 50, 100 to mygrp1, mygrp2 respectively. As expected, the cgroup with higher weight finishes execution first. Once
the process in the second cgroup finishes execution, then the weights are no longer applicable and all the resources are focused on the process in the 
first cgroup. If we assume that the process in the second cgroup takes x periods to finish execution, the process in the first cgroup should take x + x/2 = 3x/2
periods which is consistent with what we have observed.

In the second case, the second process has twice the weight as that of the first process. But the quota of the first process is double that of the quota of the
first process. We might expect that they would approximately take equal number of periods to finish execution, but we can see that the process with lesser quota
almost takes twice the number of periods as that of the other process. The reason for this can be attributed to the large amount of throttling time when 
the quota is very less compared to the period. This happens in the second process.


In the third case, I have kept the product weight * quota same in both the processes, except that the quotas in this case are actually higher compared to the 
ones in the last case. In this case, we can see that they almost take the same amount of time to finsih execution. The reason for this can be attributed to 
the observation that the throttle time in both the cases is 0. It means that both the processes don't spend any idle time even because of quota issues. 


In the last case again, I have kept the product same. But this time, the quota is low in both the cases. Hence, both the processes experience throttle time 
and the results are expected. They run for almost the same number of periods.

Analysis : 
Here, there is only one CPU Intensive process running. I placed the process in a CGroup and changed various conigurations. From tests 1 and 2, we can 
clearly see that, since there is only one CGroup, cpu.weight is irrelevant. I tested with two different values of cpu.weight and the results turned out 
to be almost similar.

After that, I experimented with various values for the quota and period of the CGroup. For 6 out of the 7 subsequent tests, I have taken the period to be 
100000. As we can see from the results, when the quota is less and when we double the quota, the number of periods is approximately halved. This can be seen 
when comparing tests 2, 3 and 4.  Also, we can see that the throttled time is very high when the quota is very less. When the quota increases, we can see
a steady decrease in the throttled time until it becomes 0 when the quota exceeds 80%. 

One observation that we can make is that when the throttle time is very less, the number of periods almost becomes constant. This becomes evident when we
consider over 90% quota.

Also, when we increase the period to 1000000 in the last test, though the time taken is very similar to case 4, during the execution, we can clearly observe
the gaps or breaks caused due to throttling.

Also, we may note that the user_usec metric values are very close in all the above test cases. This should be expected since it represents the actual time 
utilised by the program.
